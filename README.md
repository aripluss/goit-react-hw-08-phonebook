# Phonebook application

Used Redux Toolkit library for state management.

Created store with configureStore( ).

Saving / deleting a contact, as well as updating the contact filter, is
provided.

Connected React components with Redux logic using the react-redux library hooks.

A personal backend was used for development using the mockapi.io UI-service.

Used the createAsyncThunk function to declare asynchronous action generators and
execute HTTP requests.

Processing actions and changing data in the Redux state was done using the
createSlice() function.
